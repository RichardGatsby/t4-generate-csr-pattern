# t4-generate-csr-pattern
 T4 template for generating controller,service and repository classes for .net core api project. Specially intended to ease working with     Entity Framework.
 
 The classes are generated with dependency injection pattern where the dependencies the class needs are all passed in via its constructor.
 
 The class names can be generated by two ways
 * manually enter the list of strings defined in the start of the script
 * fetching database table names by defining the connection string at the start of the script
    
 For best results first run EF scaffold against a database and then use the generated DBSet names as the list of strings in this script.


# How to run 
 Just right click the GenerateClasses.tt file in visual studio and "Run custom tool"
